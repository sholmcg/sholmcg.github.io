Hi! I'm a first-year PhD student at [UCSD](http://cse.ucsd.edu/). This website is meant to store thoughts about theoretical computer science and other pieces of writing. It will mostly be notes about papers I'm reading or problems I'm thinking about. 

This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with inline LaTeX courtesy of [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).
